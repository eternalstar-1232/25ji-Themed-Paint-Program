Simple Nightcord at 25 themed paint program on python...

Just an average grade 11's first written program

It's not very good, and the codes aren't efficient or anything

(In fact, I had to teach myself def...)

I believe python is required to run it..

The steps I believe are

1. Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Go to cmd prompt, copy paste "pip install pygame", without the quotation marks

3. You can either download the main.exe file, and simply run it, or to run the original code, download both main.py and the img folder, make sure they're in the same directory, and run the code from there

If it doesn't work, you can also try to run it online through replit:
