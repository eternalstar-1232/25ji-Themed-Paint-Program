# 25ji-Themed-Paint-Program
  Simple Nightcord at 25 themed paint program on python...
  
  I don't know
  
  Just an average grade 11's first written program
  
  It's not very good, and the codes aren't efficient or anything
  
  (In fact, I had to teach myself def...)
  
  but I got full marks on it,, and enjoyed making it
  
  
  I don't know how github works,, or what files to upload
  
  Would probably need python to run this program at least..
  
  Sorry if it doesn't work, it's a bit confusing...
